This whole project comes from this:

    http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/lets-build-a-3d-graphics-software-engine--gamedev-12718

I have decided to work on this in 2D until I get the methods and classes
working as I want them to. Maybe I'll add a third dimention then.

Dependencies:

    libsdl*
    libsdl2*

This project is purely for my own learning purposes. Use it to whatever you
like.
